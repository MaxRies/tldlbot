# tldlbot
Telegram Bot for translating too long voice messages

# The modern problem
I cannot be the only one who DESPISES getting 5 minute long voice messages that are rambling on about trivialities. I cannot quickly grog them. I cannot search them. I forget half of what was said in the beginning.

# The modern solution
Just send the voice message to this bot, and it will give you a half arsed transciption that you may or may not be able to make sense of.

# How to set this up?
1. Get an account at cloud.ibm.com
2. Acquire a speech2text API token (https://cloud.ibm.com/services/speech-to-text)
3. Setup a telegram bot and acquire that token
4. clone this project
5. install poetry and pyenv
6. ´poetry install´
7. ´poetry run tldlbot´
8. Fix some errors that occur because of hardcoded paths or whatever
9. enjoy
